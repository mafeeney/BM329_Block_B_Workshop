  abstract  = "AbstractThe tree of life is one of the most important organizing
               principles in biology1. Gene surveys suggest the existence of an
               enormous number of branches2, but even an approximation of the
               full scale of the tree has remained elusive. Recent depictions
               of the tree of life have focused either on the nature of deep
               evolutionary relationships3--5 or on the known, well-classified
               diversity of life with an emphasis on eukaryotes6. These
               approaches overlook the dramatic change in our understanding of
               life's diversity resulting from genomic sampling of previously
               unexamined environments. New methods to generate genome
               sequences illuminate the identity of organisms and their
               metabolic capacities, placing them in community and ecosystem
               contexts7,8. Here, we use new genomic data from over 1,000
               uncultivated and little known organisms, together with published
               sequences, to infer a dramatically expanded version of the tree
               of life, with Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya included. The
               depiction is both a global overview and a snapshot of the
               diversity within each major lineage. The results reveal the
               dominance of bacterial diversification and underline the
               importance of organisms lacking isolated representatives, with
               substantial evolution concentrated in a major radiation of such
               organisms. This tree highlights major lineages currently
               underrepresented in biogeochemical models and identifies
               radiations that are probably important for future evolutionary
               analyses.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common nosocomial
               pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality
               internationally. Patients may become colonised or infected with
               P. aeruginosa after exposure to contaminated sources within the
               hospital environment. The aim of this study was to determine
               whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to determine
               the source in a cohort of burns patients at high risk of P.
               aeruginosa acquisition. STUDY DESIGN: An observational
               prospective cohort study. SETTING: Burns care ward and critical
               care ward in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with >7\% total
               burns by surface area were recruited into the study. METHODS:
               All patients were screened for P. aeruginosa on admission and
               samples taken from their immediate environment, including water.
               Screening patients who subsequently developed a positive P.
               aeruginosa microbiology result were subject to enhanced
               environmental surveillance. All isolates of P. aeruginosa were
               genome sequenced. Sequence analysis looked at similarity and
               relatedness between isolates. RESULTS: WGS for 141 P. aeruginosa
               isolates were obtained from patients, hospital water and the
               ward environment. Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight distinct
               clades, with a single clade representing the majority of
               environmental isolates in the burns unit. Isolates from three
               patients had identical genotypes compared with water isolates
               from the same room. There was clear clustering of water isolates
               by room and outlet, allowing the source of acquisitions to be
               unambiguously identified. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of
               biofilm DNA extracted from a thermostatic mixer valve revealed
               this was the source of a P. aeruginosa subpopulation previously
               detected in water. In the remaining two cases there was no clear
               link to the hospital environment. CONCLUSIONS: This study
               reveals that WGS can be used for source tracking of P.
               aeruginosa in a hospital setting, and that acquisitions can be
               traced to a specific source within a hospital ward.",
